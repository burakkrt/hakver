# Phase 10: Notifications & Activity Logging

## Dependencies
- Phase 6 (voting), Phase 7 (comments), and Phase 9 (moderation) must be completed

## Goals
- Notification creation (vote, comment, like, reply)
- Notification listing and mark-as-read
- Topic-based notification muting
- Real-time notifications via WebSocket
- Activity logging (all user actions)

## Tasks

### 1. Notification Module

Under `apps/api/src/modules/notification/`:

```
notification/
├── notification.module.ts
├── notification.controller.ts
├── notification.service.ts
└── notification.gateway.ts
```

### 2. API Endpoints

| Method | Path | Auth | Description |
|--------|------|------|-------------|
| GET | /notifications | JWT | Notification list (paginated) |
| GET | /notifications/unread-count | JWT | Unread notification count |
| PATCH | /notifications/:id/read | JWT | Mark notification as read |
| PATCH | /notifications/read-all | JWT | Mark all as read |
| POST | /topics/:topicId/mute | JWT | Mute topic notifications |
| DELETE | /topics/:topicId/mute | JWT | Unmute topic notifications |

### 3. Notification Creation Service

**`notification.service.ts`** — `createNotification(data)`:

1. **Mute check:** Does a recipient-topic pair exist in the `NotificationMute` table? If yes → do not create notification
2. **Self-notification prevention:** `actorId === userId` → do not create notification (e.g., liking own comment)
3. **Block check:** Has the recipient blocked the actor? → do not create notification
4. **Anonymous actor:** Notification is created but actor info is shown with an anonymous card
5. Create `Notification` record
6. Send in real-time via WebSocket

### 4. Notification Triggers

Add notification hooks to existing modules:

**Vote Module:**
- When a vote is cast → `TOPIC_VOTED` notification to topic owner
- On vote change → no new notification
- On vote withdrawal → no new notification

**Comment Module:**
- When a comment is posted → `TOPIC_COMMENTED` notification to topic owner
- When a reply is posted → `COMMENT_REPLIED` notification to parent comment owner
- When a like is given → `COMMENT_LIKED` notification to comment owner

### 5. Notification Listing

`GET /notifications?page=1&limit=20`:

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "...",
      "type": "TOPIC_COMMENTED",
      "isRead": false,
      "createdAt": "...",
      "actor": {
        "username": "testuser",
        "avatarUrl": "...",
        "rank": "Aktif Üye"
      },
      "reference": {
        "type": "TOPIC",
        "id": "...",
        "title": "Konu başlığı..."
      },
      "message": "testuser konunuza yorum yaptı"
    }
  ],
  "meta": { "total": 50, "page": 1, "limit": 20 }
}
```

**Anonymous actor** case:
```json
"actor": {
  "displayName": "Anonim Penguen #4521",
  "iconType": "penguin"
}
```

**Notification messages** (in Turkish — user-facing):
- `TOPIC_VOTED`: "{actor} konunuza oy verdi"
- `TOPIC_COMMENTED`: "{actor} konunuza yorum yaptı"
- `COMMENT_LIKED`: "{actor} yorumunuzu beğendi"
- `COMMENT_REPLIED`: "{actor} yorumunuza yanıt verdi"

### 6. WebSocket Notification Delivery

In addition to the gateway set up in Phase 6:

**User-based room:** Each authenticated user automatically joins the `user:{userId}` room (on connection establishment).

**Events:**
- Server → Client: `notification:new` → notification object
- Server → Client: `notification:unread-count` → `{ count: number }`

### 7. Topic-Based Muting

`POST /topics/:topicId/mute`:
1. Create `NotificationMute` record (`userId, topicId`)
2. Unique constraint → if already muted → 409

`DELETE /topics/:topicId/mute`:
1. Delete record
2. If not found → 404

Mute status is returned as a flag in the topic detail response:
```json
{
  "id": "...",
  "title": "...",
  "isMuted": true  // if authenticated and mute record exists
}
```

### 8. Activity Log Module

Under `apps/api/src/modules/activity-log/`:

```
activity-log/
├── activity-log.module.ts
├── activity-log.service.ts
└── activity-log.interceptor.ts
```

### 9. Activity Log Service

**`activity-log.service.ts`** — `log(data)`:

```typescript
interface ActivityLogData {
  userId: string;
  action: string;         // e.g.: "topic:create", "vote:create", "comment:like"
  targetType?: string;    // e.g.: "TOPIC", "COMMENT"
  targetId?: string;
  metadata?: Record<string, any>;
  ipAddress?: string;
  userAgent?: string;
}
```

**Logging points** (add to existing modules):
- Topic create, edit, delete
- Vote cast, change, withdraw
- Comment create, edit, delete
- Comment like/unlike
- Profile update
- Username/email change
- Account deletion
- Restriction apply/remove
- Report create/review
- Block/unblock
- Login

**IP and User-Agent:** Taken from the request via `req.ip` and `req.headers['user-agent']`. Can be automatically added via NestJS interceptor.

### 10. Topic Detail Response Update

Add `isMuted` field to the `GET /topics/:id` response created in Phase 5:
- If authenticated → check if `(userId, topicId)` record exists in the `NotificationMute` table
- If exists → `isMuted: true`, if not → `isMuted: false`
- If not authenticated → field is not returned

### 11. Admin Activity Log Endpoints

| Method | Path | Auth | Description |
|--------|------|------|-------------|
| GET | /admin/activity-logs | Admin | Activity logs (filterable) |

Filtering: userId, action, targetType, date range. Pagination is mandatory (large dataset).

## Security Checklist
- [ ] User can only see their own notifications
- [ ] No self-notifications are sent
- [ ] No notifications from blocked users
- [ ] No notification is created when muted
- [ ] Anonymous actor info is hidden in notifications
- [ ] WebSocket connection is authenticated
- [ ] Activity logs can only be viewed by admin
- [ ] IP/User-Agent is logged but not shown to users

## Test Plan

```bash
# Unit tests
cd apps/api && pnpm test

# API tests:

# 1. Notification creation
# Vote on a topic → did the topic owner receive a notification?
GET /notifications (topic owner) → TOPIC_VOTED notification present

# 2. No self-notification
# Comment on your own topic → no notification

# 3. Mark as read
GET /notifications/unread-count → { count: 1 }
PATCH /notifications/:id/read → 200
GET /notifications/unread-count → { count: 0 }

# 4. Mark all as read
PATCH /notifications/read-all → 200

# 5. Muting
POST /topics/:id/mute → 201
# Post a comment on this topic (another user) → notification not created
DELETE /topics/:id/mute → 200
# Post a comment → notification created

# 6. Block + notification
# User A blocks User B
# User B votes on User A's topic → no notification

# 7. WebSocket
# Connect to user room with Socket.io client
# Another user votes → did notification:new event arrive?

# 8. Activity log
GET /admin/activity-logs (admin) → log records
GET /admin/activity-logs (normal user) → 403
# Create topic → is there a record in the activity log?
```

## Completion Criteria

- [ ] Topic-based muting works
- [ ] Real-time notification via WebSocket works
- [ ] No self-notifications or notifications from blocked users
